# Student Report Management System (Django CRUD App + Authentication)

A Django project for managing students, courses, achievements, and support tickets in a school setting.
This app demonstrates **CRUD operations** as well as **Authentication & Role-Based Dashboards** using Django’s **Models, Views, Templates, and Forms**.

  * **Students** → view/enroll courses, achievements, support tickets.
  * **Lecturers** → manage their courses & view enrolled students.
  * **Admins** → full CRUD on users, courses, clubs, opportunities, tickets.
* Role-based dashboards (redirects based on user type).
* Admins can create new users (students, lecturers, admins) and manage them.
* Support ticket system with **status updates** (Open, In Progress, Closed).

### Student Features
